Notes for developers.

### Tagging + releasing

1. Update version number in package.json + commit with a message like "v0.0.1"
2. `git tag v0.0.1`. Use `git tag -n` to list tags and confirm, and then `git push --tags`

Package using the tag name in the steps below.

### Packaging

Travis bundles Mapbox Studio with the [atom-shell](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell) wrapper and uploads packages to S3 for hosting. There are two OSs in the travis matrix:

- linux: builds linux, win32 platforms
- osx: builds darwin (because of osx-only code signing tools)

To package:

1. **Push a commit with `[publish GITSHA]` as the message.** `GITSHA` should be a commit hash, branch name, or tag that can be used with `git checkout`. *Note: the packaging process itself will use the code in the repo as of GITSHA -- in other words, your GITSHA must be able to package itself.*
2. **Check travis logs for success.** When complete downloads will be available at:
